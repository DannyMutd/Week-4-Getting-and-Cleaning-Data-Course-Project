# Week-4-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project 
The repository contains instructions for analyzing the Human Activity Recognition dataset.

The dataset utilized in this project is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. The repository comprises three files:

CodeBook.md - a code book that outlines the data, variables, and transformations or processes implemented to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R - a script that performs data preparation and follows the five steps specified in the project definition, including 
merging the training and test sets to establish a unified data set, 
extracting measurements on the mean and standard deviation, 
naming activities using descriptive names, 
labeling the data set with descriptive variable names, 
and creating a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for every activity and subject from step 4.

FinalData.txt - an exported final data file created after completing all the aforementioned steps.
